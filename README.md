# Overview

This app makes a simple pie chart from user input values. One pages takes the name and values of the entries, and when the create button is pressed the user is directed to the next page displaying their pie chart.

I created this app to become more comfortable with mobile app development, and to learn how to use MPAndroidChart along with it.
